# Developing a Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch

This project uses the MNIST dataset for training. It has a total of 70000 handwritten digits split into train set and test set of 60000 and 10000 images respectively. The images are 28x28 pixelated grayscale images of single handwritten digits between 0 and 9.

The objective of this project is to classify a given image of handwritten digit into a integer from 0 to 9.
